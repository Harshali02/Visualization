Visualizing relation between Life Expectancy and Gross Domestic Product

A country’s economy depends on various factor, which can be shown using different development indicators. Here, Gross Domestic Product is used to show the development of various countries. </br>
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the measure of market values, final prices of the goods and services produced in the geographic boundary of any country in a specified time period. It reflects the nation’s total economic value. It considers the final value of a product, but not the intermediate good that go into it </br>

In this project, various publicly available authenticate datasets has been used. As the available datasets contained noisy information, the datasets were cleaned using Python to get the desired refined dataset </br>
 1.	WorldBank Dataset: The World Bank provides free and open access to a wide range of datasets about development in countries around the globe, together with other datasets cited in the data catalog. </br>
